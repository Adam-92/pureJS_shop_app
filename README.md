# Project of the furniture shop

The project made in pure JavaScript. It shows the furniture store.
Selected furniture goes to the cart (local storage), where we can increase their number, remove it individually or completely.
For the purposes of the project, I put a few example objects on the Contentful platform, from where after loading the DOM tree, the data is downloaded asynchronously.

The project contains:
- handling response using fetch 
- responsiveness (mobile friendly)
- styling in CSS
