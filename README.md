# Project of furniture shop

The project was made in pure JavaScript. It shows a furniture store.
Selected furniture goes to the cart (local storage), where we can increase their number, remove it individually or completely.
For the purposes of the project, I put a few example objects on the Contentful platform, from where after loading the DOM tree, the data is downloaded asynchronously.

The project contains:
- response handling using fetch 
- responsiveness (mobile friendly)
- styling in css
